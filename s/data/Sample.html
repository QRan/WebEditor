<h3>ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h3>
<p>To access PSN Services, you must create a PSN account (&quot;Account&quot;). You may view content on certain Authorized Devices depending on your country/area of residence and the PSN Services you are using. &quot;Authorized Devices&quot; means your Authorized Download Devices and your Authorized Streaming Devices as defined below in relation to PSN Services. Authorized Download Devices and Authorized Streaming Devices may change.</p>
<p>&quot;Authorized Download Devices&quot; means activated PlayStation&reg;3 computer entertainment systems, PSP&reg; (PlayStation&reg;Portable) systems, PlayStation&reg;Vita systems, PlayStation&reg;TV systems, 4K Ultra HD Media Player systems, select personal computers with Media Go software, select mobile telephones, select tablets and other authorized download devices in relation to PSN Services.</p>
<p>&quot;Authorized Streaming Devices&quot; means activated select televisions, select Blu-ray&reg; Disc players, PlayStation&reg;4 computer entertainment systems, PlayStation&reg;3 systems and other devices authorized for specific PSN Services. Through PlayStation&trade;Video, you may access content on Authorized Streaming Devices and Authorized Download Devices, if those systems are Authorized Devices for that content type.</p>

<p>Through PlayStation&trade;Vue, you may access content on activated PlayStation&reg;4 systems, PlayStation&reg;3 systems and other select Authorized Streaming Devices.</p>
<p>You may also be able to participate in the online PSN community (including chatting via voice and video with your friends) and play games online. PSN Services may not be available, or may not be supported, in some countries and some languages. We reserve the right to deny the creation of any Account at our sole discretion. Currently, there is no charge to create an Account, but there may be charges associated with certain online content or services available through PSN Services. All information provided during Account registration must be truthful and accurate. We reserve the right to cancel any Account that uses or that was created using untruthful or inaccurate information or that was created for a primary purpose that violates this agreement&#39;s terms, such as, for example, resale.</p>
<p>There are two types of Accounts: Master Accounts and Sub Accounts. All Accounts have an associated mailbox for receiving electronic text mail. If you have reached the legal age of majority, you can create a Master Account for yourself. Where available, each Master Account can create up to six (6) associated Sub Accounts. You are not permitted to create Sub Accounts for adults or persons under the legal age of majority who are not your children or for whom you are not the legal guardian. Your children must be of a certain age in order to have a Sub Account. Sub Accounts may not be available in all countries. Deletion or termination of a Master Account may result in the deletion and termination of all associated Sub Accounts.</p>
<p>A Master Account has access to and control over the following aspects of its Sub Accounts: (i) financial aspects; (ii) content availability and (iii) certain communication features. Text mail that relates to a Sub Account&#39;s purchases will be sent to the mailbox of the associated Master Account. At our sole discretion, we may send text mail to the Master Account relating to the Sub Account&#39;s other activities. The Master Account holder is jointly and severally legally and financially responsible for the actions of his or her Sub Account holders.</p>
<p>Master Account holders select their own sign-in ID and password and select the sign-in ID and password for each associated Sub Account. Account holders may be required to select their own Online ID for PSN. After signing in to your Account through a compatible web browser, you may continue to be signed in for up to 60 days. You may also have access to select PSN related sites and select Third Party Services without having to sign in. This will only apply to the web browser that you used when you sign-in. All users should safeguard their sign-in ID and password to prevent use by any other user. If you sign-in to your Account on a device that may be shared with others, you should ensure that you sign-out from your Account at the end of each session. If you do not sign-out, others may be able to access your Account and perform actions on your behalf without knowing your password. Certain information, which may include the Online ID, real name, profile photo, &quot;About Me&quot; statement, avatar pictures, country/area of residence, preferred language and recently played game titles, may be provided to all PSN Service users, including children. We have no liability for any unauthorized usage of any Account.</p>
<h3>PARENTAL CONSENT AND PARENTAL CONTROLS</h3>
<p>Where Sub Accounts are available, a child under the legal age of majority is only permitted to have a Sub Account associated with a Master Account of the child&#39;s parent or legal guardian. If you are creating a Sub Account for a child, you must provide your consent for SIE LLC to collect, use and disclose, pursuant to SIE LLC&#39;s Privacy Policy, your child&#39;s personal information for the purpose of allowing your child to participate in PSN Services; and (ii) your credit card information if requested by SIE LLC for Sub Accounts for children under the age of 13 in the United States and Canada, or under the specific age applicable to your country. Your credit card will be used as part of our method to establish your parental consent. You will not be charged a fee for creating the Sub Account. If you do not consent to the collection and disclosure of your child&#39;s information as described in SIE LLC&#39;s Privacy Policy, you will not be permitted to create a Sub Account. You will need to create for your child an Online ID that will be associated with your child&#39;s Sub Account. Please note that a user&#39;s real name, profile photo and Online ID may be viewable by all PSN Services users and, depending on a user&#39;s activities, the real name, profile photo and Online ID may be publicly available and viewable via the Internet by those outside the PSN Services. For example, if a user submits a posting to an online blog related to the PSN Services, that user&#39;s Online ID may be associated with the post in a manner that is publicly available.</p>
<p>The Master Account may restrict the ability of a Sub Account to communicate with other PSN Services users by setting the Restrict Chat option to &quot;YES,&quot; which is the default setting. Please beware of limitations to the Restrict Chat option. With Restrict Chat set to &quot;YES,&quot; your child still may receive text emails from PSN users, including adults, in your child&#39;s Account mailbox in the PlayStation&reg;3 system or via Group Messaging in the PlayStation&reg;Vita system. The parent&#39;s Master Account will not be notified of text emails sent to a child&#39;s Sub Account mailbox. In addition, the Restrict Chat option may not apply to certain types of interactive features in game content that may be used to facilitate user communication. The Master Account may restrict a Sub Account from posting User Generated Media Content your child has created or viewing material posted by other users by setting the Restrict User Generated Media option to &quot;YES&quot;. &quot;User Generated Media Content&quot; means content created by users that may include photos, videos, music, drawings and other content created or imported by users in games, apps and system software features. This will not prevent posting or viewing User Generated Media Content through chat or messaging (which is controlled by the Restrict Chat option stated above). As the parent or legal guardian, you are responsible for monitoring your child&#39;s access to or use of PSN Services, as well as any communications made or received by your child on or through PSN Services.</p>
<p>The Master Account may restrict a Sub Account&#39;s access to game and video content if the content is rated by using the Restrict Content setting. Some content may be objectionable to or inappropriate for some users, including children under a certain age, which may vary from country to country. Please consider your child&#39;s age and check any content ratings and descriptions where available, before you access, download or purchase access to any items or permit your child to do so. In some cases, third parties provide ratings or descriptions for items, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. Not all content is rated.</p>
<p>Some content that you access on your PlayStation&reg;4 systems, PlayStation&reg;3 system, PSP&reg; system, PlayStation&reg;Vita system, other Authorized Device, other PlayStation&trade;Now Device may be accessible by all users of that system or device. Please monitor all access to content that may be objectionable or age inappropriate. Parental controls implemented through these devices may not apply to certain types of content that may be used to facilitate user communication, certain categories of downloadable content or certain categories of streamed material. Parental controls may also not apply to content that is not rated. Your child may not be able to access some content or play games rated for users older than his or her registered age. In some countries, parents and legal guardians with Master Accounts will be permitted to set their parental controls to override restrictions on certain materials for associated Sub Accounts. Please see our PSN Services related websites (including http://playstation.com/) and your Account settings pages for further information.</p>

<p>Content and services provided to you on PSN Services, include content and services created or published by third parties. Third parties may administer access to some content or services, including delivery, gameplay, community management or customer service. To enable third parties to provide such access to you, SIE LLC or SIEA must provide them with your personal information.

Content delivered in this manner is subject to this agreement&#39;s terms. You can change your device settings so that it does not download content automatically by setting the automatic download option to &quot;OFF&quot;.</p>
<h3>WALLET</h3>
<p>All access to content on PSN Services may only be purchased using funds from a wallet associated with your Account. Your wallet will be used to purchase content, licenses or services offered through PSN. All transactions made by the Sub Account or the Master Account must be made through the Master Account&#39;s wallet. A Sub Account does not have a separate wallet. Master Accounts can set a maximum spending amount for each Sub Account, effective at the beginning of the following month. A Master Account holder can fund the wallet up to a maximum amount determined by us (&quot;Limit&quot;), using either (i) a credit or debit card; (ii) a prepaid card or promotional code with a specified value where available; or (iii) other payment methods approved by us and made available from time to time in each specific country. <strong>WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REVERSE OR REFUND UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES MADE USING ANY AVAILABLE PAYMENT METHOD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, FUNDS ADDED TO THE WALLET ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND NON-TRANSFERABLE.</strong> Wallet funds have no value outside PSN and can only be used to purchase access to content through PSN Services and certain limited Third Party Services. Subject to applicable law, wallet funds that are deemed abandoned or unused by law will not be returned or restored.</p>
<h3>PREPAID CARDS AND PRODUCT CODES</h3>
<p>SIE LLC, SIEA, or its affiliates may provide prepaid cards that allow users to redeem content on PSN Services or fund the wallet. The value of a prepaid card contributes to the Limit. If you acquire a prepaid card that has a value that, when added to the wallet&#39;s existing balance, exceeds the Limit, you will not be able to apply the value of the prepaid card to the wallet until sufficient funds have been spent from the wallet to allow the sum of the full value of the prepaid card and wallet to be equal to or less than the Limit. Except as permitted by SIE LLC or SIEA, the Master Account wallet will only accept prepaid cards with currency value from the same country as the one designated for the Master Account.</p>
<p>SIE LLC, SIEA its affiliates or third parties may provide product codes which can be used to access content, including promotional content. Product codes may not be available in all countries or to all users, and age restrictions may apply. Some product codes must be used before a specified expiration date and in accordance with specified terms and conditions. Unless otherwise stated, product codes may be used once only by the recipient and may not be transferred or sold to any other person.</p>
<p>Neither SIE LLC nor SIEA is responsible or liable for any claims arising as a result of prepaid cards or product codes, including any problems or defects in connection with prepaid cards or product codes. Your use of the prepaid card is subject to this agreement&#39;s terms. Additional terms and conditions may accompany the prepaid card or the product code.</p>
<h3>TRANSACTIONS</h3>
<p>All transactions made through your Master Account or an associated Sub Account are solely between you and SIE LLC. By completing a transaction through your Master Account or allowing a transaction to take place through an associated Sub Account, you are (i) agreeing to pay for all transactions made by the Master Account and its associated Sub Accounts, including recurring charges for subscriptions that are not cancelled; (ii) authorizing SIE LLC to deduct from the wallet and charge your credit card or other applicable payment instrument or payment mechanism all applicable fees due and payable for all transactions made by the Master Account and its associated Sub Accounts; and (iii) agreeing to any applicable Usage Terms and the terms and conditions associated with use of the particular content or service. To the extent permitted by applicable law, all transactions are final upon their completion and may be deemed to be governed by law and regulatory requirements applicable at the time the transaction was completed. You may have the option to order a license for certain content, including bundles of content such as seasons of television series, from the PSN Services in advance of the time come or all of the content is first released for license via the PSN Services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to deduct funds from your wallet for any such pre-order or bundle order at the time of your request, but some or all of the content may not be available until it is released for license via the PSN Services. You acknowledge and agree that content included in bundles is subject to change with or without notice, subject to applicable laws. <strong>YOU MAY NOT CANCEL A PRE-ORDER OR AN ORDER FOR A CONTENT BUNDLE AT ANY TIME AND REFUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR PRE-ORDERS OR FOR CONTENT BUNDLES, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAWS. </strong>Access to content is not transferable except as expressly allowed under applicable terms of service. Prior to completing a transaction, you are encouraged to review the description of the content or service you are licensing and the content itself, where available. On some devices, you may have the option to select a password or PIN to protect your credit card information at the time you complete a transaction. After selecting this option, you must enter your password or PIN to complete any future transactions with your credit card. Users should enable this function and safeguard their password or PIN to prevent others who may use the same device from being able to make purchases or access your credit card information. We reserve the right to deduct from the wallet any fee, penalty or other charge resulting from a Master Account holder&#39;s request to the Master Account holder&#39;s credit card company or other payment processor to reverse charges relating to a transaction. We reserve the right to deduct from the wallet all bank fees related to transactions made by the Master Account and its associated Sub Accounts, including domestic and international transaction fees. We reserve the right to terminate the Master Account and all Sub Accounts associated with the Master Account for failure to complete transaction payments. In lieu of termination of the Master Account, we may elect to provide a mechanism by which a Master Account may fund the wallet to prevent the Master Account and its associated Sub Accounts from being terminated. We reserve the right to change or withdraw features, specifications, prices, services and content at any time, without notice to you. <strong>WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY REFUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A PRICE DROP, A SUBSEQUENT PROMOTIONAL OFFERING OR PRODUCT REMOVAL, AND THE FEE APPLICABLE TO YOUR TRANSACTION WILL BE THE FEE THAT WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.</strong> Special product, prices and promotions are no longer valid once they are changed or removed. Prices listed do not include sales tax. Applicable sales tax will be calculated and added at the time you complete a transaction. In certain jurisdictions, local laws require that prices include all applicable taxes, in which case this will be indicated at the time of the transaction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, all transactions are subject to the laws of the State of California, County of San Mateo.</p>
<p>You may be able to make transactions only with a designated Sony regional company which is determined by your country/area of residence. Your country/area of residence may be verified by your credit or debit card number and may be rejected if the information does not match. If you are a Master Account holder, you will receive an email summary for each transaction after it is made, if you have provided a valid, current, operational email address. Please print and retain these emails for your records. You can view your transaction history in the Account management area.</p>
<p>Errors in listed prices, product descriptions, and associated terms and conditions may occur. If we discover an error in the price of items you have ordered, we will contact you. You will have the option of either reconfirming your order at the correct price or canceling it. If we are unable to contact you, your order will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Upon our confirmation of your transaction, you may access the item you ordered through your Account that you used to order the item, until such time as we remove the item or your license to access or use the item expires. We encourage you to download or access the item immediately after completing your transaction. You bear all risk of loss for accessing the content, including completing the download of any content, maintaining a continuous Internet connection with sufficient speed, ensuring that you have the necessary capabilities to view the content, including content provided in 4K ultra high definition (&quot;4K UHD&quot;), three dimension (&quot;3D&quot;) or high definition format, and for any loss of content you have downloaded, including any loss due to a file corruption or hard drive crash. You are solely responsible if you do not choose to download or access the content before it is removed or your license expires, and for ongoing storage and safekeeping of the content. We are not obligated to provide you with replacement copies for any reason.</p>
<p>If you do not have sufficient funds in your wallet to complete a transaction and you have previously entered your credit card information or another payment instrument or payment mechanism, we may automatically charge your credit card or the other applicable payment instrument or payment mechanism a minimum amount determined by us (&quot;Minimum Fee&quot;) to complete the transaction, even if the Minimum Fee exceeds the total amount of your order. Any difference between the Minimum Fee and the total amount of your order will be credited to your wallet. Additional procedures apply to subscription purchases. Please read &quot;SUBSCRIPTIONS &amp; FREE TRIALS&quot; section of this agreement for details. <strong>PAYMENTS FOR ACCESS TO CONTENT OR SERVICES ARE NOT REFUNDABLE, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</strong></p>

Except for rights explicitly granted to you, all rights in the Video Content are reserved by SIE LLC, SIEA, its affiliates and its licensors.</p>
<p>Live Stream Content:</p>
<p>Live Stream Content comprises live or near-live transmissions of Live Events and can be viewed at the time of, and simultaneously with the occurrence of the Live Events themselves. Live Stream Content may be available for an extended period (&quot;Event Viewing Term&quot;) past the occurrence of the applicable Live Event. The Event Viewing Term and any applicable Usage Terms for Live Stream Content will be displayed to you prior to finalizing your purchase. You may select the Authorized Device on which you want to view your Live Stream Content, and you may be able to view it on only one Authorized Device at a time. You may access Live Stream Content at any point during the Live Event provided that you may be unable to view any part of the Live Stream Content which occurred prior to the start of your viewing. You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over: (i) the start and finish time of a Live Event; (ii) the duration of a Live Event; or (iii) the content of a Live Event (including the quality or suitability of such content).

<p>Your access to streams and recordings of Live Events may also be subject to, and you agree to comply with, the terms and conditions of Live Event Partners, which shall be made available by such Live Event Partner.</p>
<p>Ad Supported Content:</p>
<p>Ad Supported Content comprises Video Content which contains or is displayed with advertising, marketing or other promotional materials (together, the &quot;Promotional Materials&quot;) and which may be accessed through PlayStation&trade;Video or PlayStation&trade;Vue by way of streaming only. Promotional Materials may be displayed in or around the Ad Supported Content by any means selected by us or its Ad Supported Content Partners (defined below) from time to time in their sole discretion. By accessing a stream of Ad Supported Content you acknowledge and agree that such stream may include, comprise or be displayed with Promotional Materials which may delay or interrupt the playback of the Video Content. You agree that we may prevent you from skipping or otherwise manipulating the display of Promotional Materials, and, if so, you agree not to attempt to access Ad Supported Content in any manner not prescribed by us. We do not endorse any third party advertisement or promotional material (including the Promotional Materials) associated with Ad Supported Content in any manner and gives no warranty or other assurance in relation to any products or services featured in such advertisements and promotional materials.</p>

Ad Supported Content may be streamed for playback through your Authorized Devices provided that the Ad Supported Content may be limited such that it is accessible by only one Authorized Device, at any one time.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that certain Ad Supported Content may be hosted or delivered to you by or through third party licensors, providers or partners (&quot;Ad Supported Content Partners&quot;). While we endeavor to collaborate with reputable and professional Ad Supported Content Partners, except to the extent required by applicable laws, we cannot guarantee that such content (including all associated Promotional Materials, corresponding meta-data, artwork and other peripheral materials) will be complete and accurate, comply with applicable laws, correspond to its description, be suitable or appropriate for a particular age group, or be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or delay.</p>

<p>Licensed Rental Content (excluding Licensed Rental Content in 4K UHD):</p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content will have a time period during which you can begin playback post purchase (&quot;Rental Term&quot;). Once you begin playback of your Licensed Rental Content, that content is viewable for up to 24 hours or such other period notified to you prior to finalizing your rental payment (&quot;Rental Viewing Period&quot;). The Rental Term and any applicable Usage Terms for each Licensed Rental Content item will be displayed to you prior to finalizing your rental payment. After the applicable Rental Viewing Period or Rental Term ends, whichever occurs first, you will not be able to view the Licensed Rental Content unless you obtain an additional license for that content.</p>
<p>You may select the Authorized Device on which you want to view your Licensed Rental Content, but you may view it on only one Authorized Device at a time and in some cases on a limited number of Authorized Devices. You may view the content from any one of your Authorized Devices, except that in some cases if the Licensed Rental Content is in high definition or 3D format, it may not be viewable on some Authorized Devices. If the Licensed Rental Content is in 3D format, it may be viewed on one PlayStation&reg;3 system that is an Authorized Device. Licensed Rental Content may not be transferred between an Authorized Download Device and an Authorized Streaming Device. Because some devices may be both an Authorized Download Device and an Authorized Streaming Device, you may, in certain cases, be able to initiate a stream of Licensed Rental Content on one such device and subsequently download that Licensed Rental Content to that same device. However, if you download or begin to download Licensed Rental Content to a device that is an Authorized Download Device, you may not subsequently stream that Licensed Rental Content.</p>
<p>For Licensed Rental Content in 3D, high definition and standard definition format, the Rental Viewing Period begins when you begin to stream the Licensed Rental Content or begin playback of a downloaded version of that content, whichever you do first. For Licensed Rental Content in 4K UHD format, the 4K Rental Viewing Period begins immediately after you confirm your rental payment. Once playback of Licensed Rental Content in high definition or standard definition format has started on an Authorized Streaming Device, you may not be able to view that content using any other Authorized Device without a separate license payment. If you start playback of a downloaded version of Licensed Rental Content in high definition or standard definition format on an Authorized Download Device, the Account that ordered the Licensed Rental Content may, during the Authorized Term, be able to transfer that content to a limited number of Authorized Download Devices, as described below.</p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content in standard definition format downloaded onto an Authorized Download Device may be transferred to up to a total of six additional Authorized Download Devices with the exception of 4K Ultra HD Media Player systems. Downloaded Licensed Rental Content in standard definition format may be transferred between select personal computers with Media Go Software and PSP&reg; handheld entertainment systems, select mobile telephones, and select tablets. Downloaded Licensed Rental Content in standard definition format may also be transferred between a PlayStation&reg;3 system and PSP handheld entertainment systems, PlayStation&reg;Vita handheld entertainment systems, and PlayStation&reg;TV entertainment systems. Following such transfer, the Licensed Rental Content will no longer be available on the sending Authorized Download Device.</p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content in 4K UHD:</p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content in 4K UHD format is viewable for 24 hours (or such other period displayed to you prior to finalizing your rental payment) starting immediately after finalizing your rental payment.</p>
<p>Licensed Rental Content in 4K UHD format may be downloaded solely to one 4K Ultra HD Media Player system and can only be viewed on a connected device that is capable of displaying such content and you are prohibited from viewing or transferring that content on any other Authorized Device, including other 4K Ultra HD Player systems, without a separate license payment.</p>
<p>Other Licensed Content:</p>
<p>Other Licensed Content may be downloaded to Authorized Download Devices and may also be streamed to Authorized Streaming Devices, subject to the terms of this agreement. For Other Licensed Content that is downloaded, you may view such content for an unlimited number of times on Authorized Download Devices only. For Other Licensed Content that is streamed, you may be prohibited from streaming multiple titles of Other Licensed Content or multiple streams of a single title of Other Licensed Content from your Account at any one time. <strong>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT OR REMOVE THE AVAILABILITY TO STREAM OR RE-DOWNLOAD OTHER LICENSED CONTENT AT ANY GIVEN TIME WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU</strong>. After ordering Other Licensed Content, we encourage you to immediately download such content, where supported, on all Authorized Download Devices on which you may want to later view such content. You may have the option, as available, to order, free of charge, high definition and/or standard definition versions of Other Licensed Content ordered in 4K UHD format, and such standard definition and/or high definition versions of Other Licensed Content will be subject to the terms of this agreement. We reserve the right to withdraw such option at any time without notice to you.</p>
<p>Other Licensed Content in standard definition format downloaded onto an Authorized Download Device may be copied to up to a total of six additional Authorized Download Devices with the exception of 4K Ultra HD Media Player systems. Downloaded Other Licensed Content in standard definition format may be copied between select personal computers with Media Go Software and PSP&reg; handheld entertainment systems, select mobile telephones, and select tablets. Downloaded Other Licensed Content in standard definition format may be copied between a PlayStation&reg;3 system and PSP&reg; handheld entertainment systems, PlayStation&reg;Vita handheld entertainment systems, and PlayStation&reg;TV entertainment systems. Other Licensed Content in 3D or high definition format may be downloaded and viewed on only one PlayStation&reg;3 system, and may not be transferred. Other Licensed Content in 4K UHD format may be downloaded to up to three 4K Ultra HD Media Player systems that are Authorized Devices and may only be viewed on a connected device capable of displaying 4K UHD content.</p>
<p>You may have the option to order Video Content in 4K UHD, 3D, high definition and standard definition format. You acknowledge that delivery of content is dependent on variables not under our control, including the speed and availability of your broadband or network connection. You may experience delays or technical difficulties caused by or related to such variables. If you have ordered Video Content and view it using an Authorized Streaming Device, you may not be able to view content in the format that you have ordered due to such variables. <strong>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO VIEW OR HAVE DIFFICULTY VIEWING DUE TO SUCH VARIABLES. </strong>We strongly encourage you to order content suitable for your viewing capabilities. You bear all responsibility for ensuring that you have the viewing capabilities to view content in the appropriate format or at all.</p>
<p>Proper activation of an Authorized Device by the Account that ordered the Video Content is required for all downloads, transfers, copies and viewings. Video Content is connected to the Account used to order that content. Each Account can activate no more than the maximum number of Authorized Devices, excluding 4K Ultra HD Media Players, regardless of the number of copies of Video Content ordered. Video Content may not be transferred from one Account to another. You may not exceed the total number of Accounts on any Authorized Device. Please refer to http://playstation.com/ and your Account settings pages for more information on the total number of permitted Accounts. We reserve the right to limit the number of times an Authorized Device may be activated or deactivated.</p>
<p>Downloading or streaming is not permitted outside the Authorized Term. In addition, once Video Content has been downloaded or accessed, you may not be able to download it again without an additional license.</p>
<p>Some content such as movie trailers may not be representative of the actual feature presentation. Digitalized versions of some content may not be identical with the original formatted content or previously released versions of the same titled content.</p>
<p>Video output in certain formats may require additional equipment, sold separately.</p>
<h3>PLAYSTATION&trade;NOW CONTENT</h3>
<p>Subject to this agreement&#39;s terms and any additional terms for the particular content, we offer interactive entertainment and gaming content through PlayStation&trade;Now (&quot;PlayStation Now Content&quot;) to Account holders in select territories for your personal, private, non-commercial use on PlayStation&trade;Now Devices. PlayStation Now Content may be offered in different forms, such as on a subscription and on a single transaction basis. License payments for PlayStation Now Content are made through the wallet. Additional software for licensing, using or managing PlayStation Now Content may be required depending on the Authorized Streaming Device you use.</p>
<p>PlayStation Now Content available for use and the features available on PlayStation&trade;Now are subject to change and revision at any time. Certain PlayStation Now Content and features made available to you are based on the IP address used by the PlayStation&trade;Now Device at the time you access the service. If you choose to use certain features of PlayStation&trade;Now, additional terms and limitations may apply.</p>
<p>PlayStation Now Content offered on a single transaction basis is licensed for a limited time during which you will need to begin access and play (&quot;Play Period&quot;). The Play Period for PlayStation Now Content will be made available to you prior to finalizing your payment. Once you finalize payment, that PlayStation Now Content is made available to you as a licensed copy for rental only for period that you purchased (&quot;Rental Period&quot;). After the applicable Play Period or Rental Period ends, whichever occurs first, you will not be able to access or use that PlayStation Now Content unless you obtain an additional license for that PlayStation Now Content.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that delivery and use of PlayStation Now Content, including during the entire Rental Period, is dependent on variables not under our control, including the speed and availability of your broadband connection, your geographic location, and the availability of PS Now servers. You may experience delays or technical difficulties caused by or related to these variables. The use of PlayStation Now Content may be interrupted if you do not register, provide certain information about your PlayStation&trade;Now Device or your PlayStation&trade;Now Device does not remain continuously connected online to the Internet. Some of PlayStation&trade;Now&#39;s features may require you to install and operate applications on your PlayStation&trade;Now Device. Failure to properly install and operate these applications will prevent you from using those features of PlayStation&trade;Now that rely upon these applications. We cannot guarantee that streams of PlayStation Now Content will be delivered uninterrupted, error-free and without fault or delay. <strong>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY PLAYSTATION NOW CONTENT THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO USE OR HAVE DIFFICULTY USING DUE TO THESE VARIABLES AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
<p>PlayStation Now Content may only be used on one PlayStation&trade;Now Device at a time and in some cases on a limited number of PlayStation&trade;Now Devices. PlayStation&trade;Now seeks to detect which PlayStation&trade;Now Device is receiving PlayStation Now Content and some of your PlayStation&trade;Now Devices may not stream or may have a stream terminated if you are using content on another one of your PlayStation&trade;Now Devices.</p>
<p>No ownership rights in PlayStation Now Content are transferred or assigned to you and all ownership rights in PlayStation Now Content are retained by the owners of those rights. Except for rights explicitly granted here, all rights in PlayStation Now Content are reserved by SIE LLC, SIEA, its affiliates and its licensors. Some PlayStation Now Content may not provide the same features or be identical to the original formatted content or versions of other same-titled content.</p>
<h3>SUBSCRIPTIONS &amp; FREE TRIALS</h3>
<p>SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>We may offer you the opportunity to purchase, order or download subscriptions that provide access to particular products or services for a specified period of time. Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel the subscription. The cost of each subscription will automatically be deducted from your wallet at the beginning of each subscription term without further notice to you. Subscriptions are available to Master Accounts and may be available to Sub Accounts for purchase, order or download, provided that the Master Account accepts the terms and conditions of the subscription for an associated Sub Account. Subscriptions may not be shared among any Accounts, including the Master Account with its associated Sub Accounts. However, some game content and features that are made available for certain subscriptions may be accessible by other users of the home Authorized Device of a subscriber or an Authorized Device where a subscriber is logged in.</p>
<p>Some subscriptions may be single-product- or service-specific, while other subscriptions may be comprised of several content items, services or features, which may include special offers, discounted, free, paid-for, exclusive or early access content or automatic download of selected content. Individual content items and service within a composite subscription may also be offered for sale separately as a one-time order or single-product-specific subscription. Subscription charges may be increased at the end of each subscription term. As each product offering will have terms and conditions that vary, please review each product description, cost and subscription term carefully before order, payment or download. As with all orders, please print and retain a copy of your email order receipt for your reference.</p>
<p>If you do not have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover the cost of your subscription at the time the subscription is renewed, the subscription will be cancelled unless the automatic funding feature on the Master Account is set to &quot;ON.&quot; If the automatic funding feature on the Master Account is set to &quot;ON,&quot; your credit card or other applicable payment instrument or mechanism may be charged automatically the greater of the subscription cost or the Minimum Fee. Every time you or one of your associated Sub Accounts purchases, orders or downloads a new subscription, the automatic funding feature in the Master Account is set automatically to &quot;ON.&quot; The Master Account holder may change this setting to &quot;OFF&quot; at any time. However, the setting will return to &quot;ON&quot; upon subsequent purchase, order or download of any subscription, so setting your automatic funding feature to &quot;OFF&quot; may not effectively cancel your subscription. In order to stop receiving a subscription and avoid being charged, you must cancel your subscription in the Account Management area.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive your subscription, you must cancel your subscription by using Account management or contacting customer service at www.playstation.com/support or the address located at the end of this agreement. Cancellation will take effect at the beginning of the next subscription term. <strong>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, UPON CANCELLATION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR TERMINATION OF THE MASTER ACCOUNT OR SUB ACCOUNT, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR CREDIT FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID. </strong>Further, you will not be able to access content or services provided in your subscription except as permitted by us. Content that you downloaded onto a device and that was provided to you through a subscription at no additional cost beyond the subscription price may not be accessible. Game play information, including trophies earned during a trial offer, promotional period or subscription term may not be available.</p>
<p>FREE TRIALS</p>
<p>We may also offer a free trial period with some subscriptions. Subject to the terms and conditions of the free trial offer, if you do not cancel your subscription before expiration of a trial period, your wallet may automatically be charged the cost of the subscription at the beginning of each subscription term without further notice to you. To avoid being charged, you must cancel your subscription prior to expiration. Please review all terms and conditions carefully before you accept any offer or promotion.</p>

<h3>BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</h3>

Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR PSN SERVICES ONLINE ID, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY THROUGH ARBITRATION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong> IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SONY ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION, ATTN: SONY LEGAL DEPARTMENT: DISPUTE RESOLUTION, TO GIVE THE SONY ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this section.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 20, 2011.

<p><strong>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator</strong>. If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>.

However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (&quot;Supplementary Procedures&quot;) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Sony Entity you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, excerpt for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Arbitration</strong>. You or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo County, California or the United States county in which you reside.
